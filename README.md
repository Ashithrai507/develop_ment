INTRODUCTION:

DevOps is a culture and set of practices that integrates **development (Dev)** and **operations (Ops)** to improve collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery.

**DevOps Lifecycle:**

**Plan â†’ Develop â†’ Build â†’ Test â†’ Release â†’ Deploy â†’ Operate â†’ Monitor**

## 

## Version Control with Git

- **What is Git?**
    
    A **distributed version control system** that tracks code changes and enables collaboration.
    
- **Key Commands:**
    - `git clone` â†’ Clone repository
    - `git commit` â†’ Save changes
    - `git push` â†’ Send changes to remote repo
    - `git pull` â†’ Get updates from remote repo
    - `git branch` â†’ Work on multiple versions
- **Collaboration with GitHub:**
    - Pull Requests (PRs)
    - Issue tracking
    - Team workflows
- **Hands-on Exercise:**
    
    Practice Git basics: branching, making changes, staging, committing, pushing, merging, and deleting branches.

## 3. ðŸ”¹ Basics of CI/CD

- **Definition:**
    - **CI (Continuous Integration):** Automates integration of code changes into shared repo.
    - **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment):** Automates release and deployment to production.
- **Tools:**
    - Jenkins
    - GitHub Actions
    - GitLab CI/CD
- **Benefits:**
    - Faster testing & deployment cycles
    - Reduced human errors
- **YAML Basics:**
    - Human-readable configuration language
    - Used for pipelines & workflows
    - Syntax includes key-value pairs, lists, and indentation for nesting
- **GitHub Actions with YAML:**
    - Workflows defined in `.github/workflows/`
    - Workflows specify events (push, pull request) and jobs (build, test, deploy)
- **Hands-on Exercise:**
    
    Create a GitHub Actions pipeline for automating a simple build process.

## 4. Introduction to Containers

- **What are Containers?**
    
    Lightweight, isolated environments for running applications consistently.
    
- **Docker Basics:**
    - **Images** â†’ Templates for containers
    - **Containers** â†’ Running instances of images
    - **Dockerfile** â†’ Script to build images
- **Benefits:**
    - Portability (runs anywhere)
    - Scalability
    - Consistent environments
    - Resource efficiency
    - Faster deployments
- **Basic Docker Commands:**
    - `docker build` â†’ Build image
    - `docker run` â†’ Start container
    - `docker stop` â†’ Stop container
    - `docker ps` â†’ List running containers

## 5. Configuration Management Basics

- **Definition:**
    
    Automating system setup, configuration, and maintenance.
    
- **Ansible:**
    - Uses YAML-based playbooks
    - Workflow: Write playbook â†’ Define inventory â†’ Run playbook â†’ Apply changes
- **Benefits:**
    - Ensures consistency
    - Efficiency and speed
    - Reduces human errors
    - Supports version control & collaboration
    - Faster recovery during failures

## 6. ðŸ”¹ Monitoring and Logging

- **Importance of Monitoring:**
    - Ensures uptime
    - Tracks performance
    - Detects issues early
- **Types of Monitoring:**
    - Infrastructure monitoring
    - Application monitoring
    - User experience monitoring
- **Tools:**
    - **Prometheus** â†’ Metric collection
    - **Grafana** â†’ Visualization & dashboards
- **Logging:**
    - Centralized logging with **ELK stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Benefits of Logging:**
    - Root cause analysis
    - Auditing and compliance
    - Debugging and troubleshooting
