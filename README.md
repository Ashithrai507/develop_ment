![alt text](image-1.png)
## System Overview

The proposed system is a controlled messaging application where a central server hosted on an old laptop manages all client communications. Only authorized users, approved by the server administrator, are allowed to exchange messages. The system uses the TCP protocol to ensure reliable and ordered message delivery.
The system is a centralized messaging application where an old laptop is permanently configured as a dedicated server.
Unlike LAN-based systems, clients connect to the server over the Internet, not necessarily from the same network.
